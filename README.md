# azurite
an interpreted programming language allowing you to express your thoughts in a clean and expandable code without a second thought

the main goal of azurite is and always be expressiveness
  
now that i've got you hopefully hooked let's [**get you started**](./pages/INSTALLATION.md)

# todo:
* multi-file support
* make it so users can use a command like "azurite" instead of  
  running the executable directly, preferably make it automaticly  
  update the path value when installing
* re-do the compiler as the code is a mess at the current moment
* generics
* tuples
* traits
* ranges
* enums
* match statements
* more tests
* more standard library functionality
* tools
  * command line interface
  * library manager
  * code formatter
